JASMIN's main purpose is to provide large-scale data analysis facilities to support data-intensive environmental science. To enable this, it provides a number of services in a unique purpose-built architecture to enable groups of scientists to work together collaboratively with large datasets. We can group (and colour-code!) these service groups as follows:

{% include figure.html
    image_url="assets/img/sections/section_content/service_groups.max-1000x1000.png"
    description="Service groups"
%}

## User-facing services

These are arranged as follows as the services which users can access:

{% include figure.html
    image_url="assets/img/sections/section_content/services.max-1000x1000.png"
    description="Service groups"
%}

These services are briefly described below, but for full details of how to access and use JASMIN and its component services, please consult our extensive [documentation](https://help.jasmin.ac.uk) and [training workshop materials](https://github.com/cedadev/jasmin-workshop).
