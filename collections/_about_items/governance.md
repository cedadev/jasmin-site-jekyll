Governance for JASMIN is provided by two bodies:

* The CEDA/JASMIN Board is composed of representatives from JASMIN's stakeholder community including funding bodies, host organisations and others. It defines the service which CEDA and JASMIN provide to their respective communities.
* The JASMIN Programme Board oversees delivery of JASMIN as an operational service and manages the major procurement and integration projects which are undertaken to maintain, refresh and expand JASMIN's infrastructure.

Further information about governance and stakeholder community information is available in CEDA's Annual Reports.
