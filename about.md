![JASMIN Machine Room]( {{ page.page_image }} ){:class="img-fluid w-50 float-right"}

JASMIN is a globally-unique data analysis facility. It provides storage and compute facilities to enable data-intensive environmental science. 

Over [1500 users](/users/community/) are currently supported [exploring topics](/insights)  ranging from climate change and oceanography to air pollution, earthquake deformation and analysis of wildlife populations.

Centred more around storage and data analysis than a "traditional" supercomputer, JASMIN provides flexibility for a wide range of data-intensive analysis workflows.

Tens of petabytes of storage are combined with [several types of compute resource](/about/services/): managed interactive and batch compute for building and executing large workflows, and a “community cloud” offering projects and communities a set of service components with which to build and manage their own computing needs. All with high-performance access to massive data resources, including the curated archives of the [Centre for Environmental Data Analysis (CEDA)](https://www.ceda.ac.uk).

JASMIN is designed, integrated and operated by the [Science &amp; Technology Facilities Council (STFC)](https://stfc.ukri.org/) on behalf of the [Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)](https://nerc.ukri.org/).

Architected jointly between STFC's [Scientific Computing Department](https://www.scd.stfc.ac.uk/) and [CEDA](https://www.ceda.ac.uk/) within [RAL Space](https://www.ralspace.stfc.ac.uk/), it is operated and supported by a [small but innovative team](/about/team/) with expertise in systems administration, computer science, research software engineering and environmental informatics.
