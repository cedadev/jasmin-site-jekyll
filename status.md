Status of JASMIN components and services - *coming soon*

We are currently working on systems to gather and display **metrics** from the JASMIN infrastructure: these will be presented as dashboards which show available resources and how they're being used in real time. We're also looking at how we can show the **status** of services and components, to provide a list of known issues and their status as we work to resolve them. Watch this space!
