Status of JASMIN components and services

Please see our <a href="https://www.ceda.ac.uk/en/status" class="btn btn-success btn-sm" target="_blank">status page</a> on the CEDA website which shows the status of CEDA and JASMIN services alongside news announcements.

We are currently working on systems to gather and display **metrics** from the JASMIN infrastructure: these will be presented as dashboards which show available resources and how they're being used in real time. We're also looking at how we can show the **status** of services and components, to provide a list of known issues and their status as we work to resolve them. Watch this space!
